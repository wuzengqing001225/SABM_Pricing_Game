# SABM Pricing Game
This is the source code for paper "'Guinea Pig Trials' Utilizing GPT: A Novel Smart Agent-Based Modeling Approach for Studying Firm Competition and Collusion".

## Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM)
We now further propose a simulation framework based on large language model. Please see the work at **[Smart Agent-Based Modeling: On the Use of Large Language Models in Computer Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06330)**.

The updated code for SABM Pricing Game is available at: https://github.com/Roihn/SABM.
